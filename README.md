
BitSTD stands for Bit Standard Index, a blockchain standard index set, Standard & Poor's of blockchain ecology.
BitSTD is dedicated to build decentralized and trust-worthy approach to collectively maintain a solid standard database and develop a series of digital standards in the area of blockchain.

BSI is short for Bit Standard Index.

BitSTD Version 1.0 contains BSI7, BSI20 and BSI30.

BSI7=BTC,ETH,BCH,XRP,ADA,LTC,NEO
The top seven tokens with the largest market capitalization, indexed by the square root ratio, represent the changes in the value of the top seven major currencies relative to bitcoin. The market capitalization of BSI7 exceeds 75% of the overall market, and the ups and downs represent the largest capital flows.

The rules are as follows:
1. Choose top 7 highest market value digital currencies as the measurement standard of the index.
2. For the coins whose circulation amount exceeds 100 million, the overall circulation amount would be 100 million, and the price is raised by calculation. Market value is ensured not the change. (Price calculation function: price=original price*(original circulation amount/100 million))
3. Coins traded in fewer than 3 mainstream exchanges are not considered.
4. Dynamic elimination mechanism is adopted that when the 8th has market value exceeding the 7th for 30 consecutive days, and when condition 3 is met, it will replace the 7th to be counted into the index.

BSI20=BSI7+ETC+IOTA+XMR+NEO+XEM+ADA+EOS+QTUM+XLM+ZEC+OMG+LSK+HSR
BSI20 Index tracking the world's largest market capitalization of the top 20 basket of currencies relative to the price changes in Bitcoin.

BSI30=ITO(Initial Token Offering) Index.
The BSI30 Index aims to track changes in the world's top 30 tokens of assets. Token assets are applications developed on the blockchain platform. Most of the token assets are now based on the Ethereum platform and 26 of the BSI30 are based on the Ethereum platform. Given the relatively low market share of most current tokens, we selected 30 major tokens to trade initially, representing roughly 75% of the current market share, similar to the Dow Jones 30 Index. In the future, we will develop new indices to meet the needs of research and investment based on market developments. Overall, BSI30's change reflects the average status of IPO (Initial Token Offering) projects.
